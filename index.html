   <h1>Recollections Of The Old Web</h1>
   <h2>Nickelodeon Games</h2>

   One of my earliest memories of the internet was playing games on the old <span class="highlight">Nickelodeon</span> website.
   I remember rushing home after school to my neighbor's house to play several games based on my favorite television series.
   At the time, I was so amazed by the simple graphics, the music, and the gameplay. Looking back, there was something magical about how entertaining and immersive those flash games were. They were much more than basic online games, they were recollections tied to my childhood and the early exploration of the internet.
